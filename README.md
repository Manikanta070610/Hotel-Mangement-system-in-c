This simple hotel reservation system is built entirely using the C programming language and relies solely on standard input/output (stdio.h) without any external libraries. The system allows users to interact via the console to view available rooms, book a room, cancel a booking, or display all booked rooms. It maintains an in-memory record of five rooms using arrays for room numbers, availability status, and customer names. The user inputs are captured through scanf() for each operation, and responses are printed directly to the console using printf(). This makes the application lightweight and easy to compile and run on any basic C environment, including Linux terminals or simple C compilers.
